## Built with

## Challenges

- A challenge I faced when working on my portfolio was getting images to load when I looped through my projects in the data.json getting the path for the images.
To solve this I learnt GraphQL and started using it throughout my portfolio.
- Design. It took a while before I found the design I liked enough to use. I originally designed my porfolio in Figma and then made it in Gatsby, however the design from Figma to my actualy portfolio changed as I started working in Gatbsy as I wanted to change the layout of how things looked.

## What I learnt

- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) - I learnt how to use Gatbsy and how to create a static site.
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) - I learnt how to manipulate data through GraphQL.
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - I learnt how to organize my components and styles.
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) - Hosting Service I used for my portfolio.

## Continued development

As this was my first time using Gatsby I learnt a lot, and made lots of mistakes. In the future I'll be able to structure my projects a lot more clearly and more efficiently as I won't have to struggle as much when working with data.

### Things To Learn:
- [Gatsby-Image-Plugin](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-image/) - I'd like to laern more about how to create better images.
- Best Practices in Gatsby and GraphQL.
- Reinforce HTML and CSS knowledge and Responsive Design.
- More About Accessibility
